# Condo Manager

## Overview

This project is **_REST API_** with operations to manage all the necessary activities in your condo, built using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). It runs on Java 8 and a MySQL database (configurable on `src/main/resources/application.properties`). Dependecies are managed by Maven. 

For now, it's possible to:

* Create a new user profile
* Authenticate as an existent user
* Once authenticated, update it's own user profile

Check the wiki for more details about how it all works.
